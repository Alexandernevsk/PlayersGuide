    TODO: Learning more about website design try HTML and CSS;
            -> Go further with website of last lesson;                                  CHECK
            -> Trying js script to understand more about get-request                    NOPE
            -> Recreate css for the html file, with comments (Previous one was like managing a byzantine bureaucracy)  WORKING PROCESS

            -> Going further with player's guide Day39



10:46
Start with recreate css and html file of the older html files.
Asking some questions about certain java topics;
    -Inheritance
    -Interfaces
    -Shallow vs deep copy
    -Levels of immutability

11:14 going for a smoke;

   11:20: resuming task;
    I have commented all css styles.
    Copied existing classes in my new website lay-out.

13:00 (around this time) break smoke and something to eat

15:00 Still copying classes tried to adjust pictures to be perfectly oval,
 Unfortunately that didn't work.

15:30 around this time I gave up with being a perfectionist, and started Day39 "the fountain objects"




@Links
Rubymine (maybe paid software)
Else vs code or google for IDE Ruby;

- made the grid
- made the player
- Made the controller
- made the generic class for coloring the narrative items
- made interface for player actions with several subclasses implementing that functional interface
- made room class with several child classes.


 ------------> Only thing to do is to create test for checking out of bounds, which shouldn't be a problem with the array index, and connecting everything together in a game loop.

11:19 Working on the players guide day 40


12:30 break
Resume my work on the player's guide Day40
I have tried to make a randomizer for the PitRoom, that didn't work;
After much struggling decided to hardcode a location in the room;
Additionally i have made the PitRoom class work such that it gives a message based on whether
you are or aren't on the pit room.
Only thing to work-out with this function is to toggle create the logic for the adjacent rooms.

14:30
Little break and having a chat with Wubbo about databases and the current assignment Day40;

15:00 Bit tired of programming, I am reading some recommendations.
